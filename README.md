# Which Chadwickian Are You Quiz

## Description

This Personality Quiz will help you determine which Chadwickian
you are! Are you more of a Gretchen or are you
secretly a Guy Phillips? Take this quiz to find out today!

## Overview

The purpose of the Personality Quiz is to provide entertainment to the user. The
program outputs questions to the user and accepts their answer as input via the
keyboard. Finally, at the end of the quiz, the program displays which Chadwickian the player is. The player gets insight about a different friend, which can allow them to know more about the student body.


## High Level Design

At a high level, the 'Which Chadwickian Are You Quiz' works in the following way:

1. Initializes a list of scores to 0 (each score represents one of the possible outcomes)
2. Creates a list of questions and answers (each possible answer will increase
   one of the scores by 1)
3. Loops through each question and
   * Prompts the user to answer the question
   * Increases the appropriate score by 1
4. When all of the questions have been answered, use the highest score to
   display the result of the quiz.

## Methods and Classes

The Personality Quiz has several complexities. To help manage this, I have
chosen to create a `Question` class as well as breaking my program's logic 
into 3 methods: 

* `static int AskQuestion(Question)`
* `static int GetValidAnswer(List<string> answers);`
* `static string GetResult(List<int> scores, List<string> results);`

### Question Class

For this program, it is important to group together the question and answers. To
manage this, I've created a class which has two properties: a `string Question`
which will be the question being asked and a `List<string> Answers` which will
be a list of the possible answers to that questions.

### static int AskQuestion(Question q)

Displays the specified question along with each of its answers. Then, prompts
the user to select one of the answers. Finally, returns the index of the answer
the player selected.

![Ask Question](../images/PersonalityQuizAskQuestion.png)

1. Display the question
2. Loop through each answer and display it
3. Use the `GetValidAnswer` method to get the user's response
4. Return the user's response


### static int GetValidAnswer(List<string> answers)

Given a list of answers, prompts the user to enter a number corresponding to one
of the answers. If the user enters a number that is not within the specified
range, the user is asked to enter another value.

![Get Valid Answer](../images/PersonalityQuizGetValidAnswer.png)

1. Validate that there is at least 1 possible answer.
2. If the list of answers is empty, throw an exception
3. Otherwise, Display a message asking the user to select an option.
4. Store the user's response in a variable name choice
5. Validate that choice is one of the possible answers
6. If it is not a valid answer
   * Display an error message
   * Go to 3
7. Otherwise, return the user's choice. 

### static string GetResult(List<int> scores, List<string> results);

Given two lists, one representing the scores for each possible result and one
representing each possible result, determines which score is the highest and
returns the corresponding string from the results list.

![Get Result](../images/PersonalityQuizGetResult.png)

1. Initialize highest to 0. This variable represents the highest score we have
   seen so far.
2. Initialize highestIx to 0. This variable represents the index of the highest
   score we have seen so far.
3. Loop through each score in scores, tracking the index in a variable currentIx
   * If the score is greater than the highest score
     * Update highest to store the score (this is the highest score we have
       seen so far)
     * Update highestIx to store the currentIx (this is the index of the highest
       score we have seen so far)
4. After we have checked each score, highestIx should be the index of the
   highest score.
5. return results[highestIx];
